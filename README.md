ㅤㅤhihi, the host of morningsradiohour's here! so, what do i owe the pleasure?

ㅤㅤhaha jokes aside! let's make this quick since i very much value a first impression.

ㅤㅤi'll list down the basic things you should need to know abt me:

 1. my pronouns are she/her, i also don't mind they/them or he/him while in character.

 2. i'm socially inept.

 3. i mostly go online at 12-2am est or 7-9am est in pt.

that'll be all! thank you for your time!

do read my rentry and strawpage if i'm still worth of time>_<!
